This uses the jekyll Cayman theme, with some modification. 

# Jekyll Cayman theme

This is a [Jekyll][1] theme for [@jasonlong][2]'s [Cayman theme][4] on [GitHub Pages][3].

Cayman is a clean, responsive theme for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). This theme is available as an option if you use the [Automatic Page Generator](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator/) or you can copy the template and styles to use on your own.

You can preview the theme at https://jasonlong.github.io/cayman-theme or with real content at https://jasonlong.github.io/geo_pattern.
