__Toward scalable, interactive detection of Simpson’s Paradox.__

Simpson’s paradox is the phenomenon that a trend of an association
in the whole population reverses within the subpopulations
defined by a categorical variable. Detecting Simpson’s
paradox indicates surprising and interesting patterns of
the data set for the user. We show that our
approach detects cases in real data sets as well as synthetic
data sets, and demonstrate that our approach can uncover the
hidden surprising pattern by detecting occurrences of Simpson’s
paradox.
